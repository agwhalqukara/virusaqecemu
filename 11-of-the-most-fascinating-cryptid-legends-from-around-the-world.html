Its howl was said to travel through the air each night, when it searched the land for women and children to devour.</p><p>Australian Aboriginal people told many terrifying stories about the bunyip, which have continued to evolve over time. When European settlers arrived in Australia, fears of the bunyip spread further, with the Australian Museum in Sydney even exhibiting a purported bunyip skull in 1846.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-443450 alt="Alleged Bunyip Skull" width=450 height=338 data-sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/bunyip-skull.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-443450 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration of a skull said to belong to the bunyip, one of the most fascinating cryptids on this list.</span></p><p>At the time, the Sydney Morning Herald even wrote that “almost everyone became immediately aware that he had heard ‘strange sounds’ from the lagoons at night, or had seen ‘something black’ in the water.”</p><p>A year later, the Herald reported an eyewitness account of a run-in with a bunyip. A herdsman described the creature as roughly the size of a calf, with “large ears which it pricked up when it perceived him; had a thick mane of hair from the head down the neck, and two large tusks.” According to the report, the herdsman attempted to flee, and as he did so, the creature also seemed to startle and took off in the opposite direction.</p><p>Over the years, stories of bunyips have become far less terrifying, and they eventually came to be seen as harmless, grazing animals, not man-eaters.</p><p>In 1934, an Australian artist named Gerald Lewers created a sculpture depicting a bunyip as a creature that looked similar to the Diprotodon, a marsupial that lived in Australia until about 10,000 years ago — the fossils of which were often misidentified as the remains of bunyips.</p><p>After looking through this list of cryptids, learn about the <a href=#>seven scariest creatures from Native American folklore</a>.
