He said, costume designers, are “historically underpaid for too long. It’s about costume designers in the costume department being valued as a major asset to the industry and compensated accordingly.”</p><p>He noted the Costume designers guild will soon be launching a social media campaign to showcase these underpaid voices. Once again the costume designers present were encouraged by Perez to show solidarity in raising their Pay Equity Now flags.&nbsp; In the past, Perez has said, “Here’s the issue, costume designers are 85% women. Production designers are 85% men. We are working for hire. They build. We are two department heads doing what I think is an equal job. But because we are mostly women, we are getting paid less and I think that’s something that needs to be addressed as part of this movement.”</p><p>Andrew Garfield received the spotlight award, Amy Pascal and Rachel O’Connor the distinguished collaborator award, and Sharen Davis was given the career achievement award.</p><p>Below is the full list of winners for the 24th annual CDGAs:</p><p><strong>Excellence in Sci-Fi / Fantasy Film</strong></p><p>“Dune” – Jacqueline West & Robert Morgan</p><p><strong>Excellence in Contemporary Film</strong></p><p>“Coming 2 America” – Ruth E.
