It doesn’t matter if you’re a week away from your next Disney trip or years away since there are plenty of ways to squeeze in some Disney magic right from home.</p><p><strong>Download the MyDisneyExperience app</strong></p><p>If you haven’t already downloaded <a href=#>MyDisneyExperience</a>, Disney’s official mobile app, plan to do so before your next trip to the parks. The app contains everything you need to know about ride wait times, park hours, showtimes, and more. While you’re still at home planning your next Disney escape you can use the app to book and update dining reservations and FastPass selections. And if you’re not sure when your next trip will be, it never hurts to have the ability to browse dining menus and wait times whenever the planning mood strikes.</p><p><strong>Have weekly film nights or host a movie marathon</strong></p><p>Sometimes we miss out on the full experience of certain attractions at Walt Disney World because we’re not familiar with the characters or the film that’s being featured. If you have plenty of time between trips, consider having a weekly family film night. Chances are the adults in your family aren’t totally up on their Disney Junior knowledge and some of the newer Disney films, and the kids may not have seen some of the classics. The whole spectrum of Disney’s filmmaking is featured in some sense throughout the park, so whatever you do decide to watch is sure to add to your trip later on.</p><p><strong>Cook Disney-inspired meals</strong></p><p>You don’t have to physically dine in the Magic Kingdom to eat like royalty! Pick up a Disney cook book or create your own recipes inspired by your favorite meals from the parks and resorts. If you’ll be at the Walt Disney World Resort in the future, keep an eye out for official cook books and snacks that can help bring Disney-inspired meals to your kitchen at home. Chances are you’ll find everything from Mickey-shaped pasta to the spice rubs used at Flame Tree Barbecue in Disney’s Animal Kingdom, and your kitchen will start to feel like “home” before you know it!</p><p><strong>Dress the part</strong></p><p>Have you ever tried DisneyBounding? It’s one way that adults are able to show off their character-inspired outfits in Disney parks without wearing a complete costume. You can practice DisneyBounding in your day-to-day life at home by adding pops of color and accessories based on your favorite characters to your wardrobe. Not sure where to begin? Check the Dress Shop items in the Shop Disney Parks app, or visit the store during your next visit to Disney Springs.</p><p><strong>Celebrate the Magic of Disney All Year Long!</strong></p><p>Last but not least of course is bringing the magic of Disney home with our very own Celebrations Magazine and other goodies.
