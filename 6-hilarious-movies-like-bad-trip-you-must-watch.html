It follows two good friends, Chris and Bud, as they travel from Florida to New York City in a stolen automobile in order for Chris to profess his emotions to his high school crush, Maria. The two pals end up enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime (mis)adventure. If you enjoyed the film’s unusual sense of humor presented in a reverent hidden camera manner, we’ve put together a selection of films that you might appreciate as well. The majority of these films, including ‘Bad Trip,’ are available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.</p><h3>Bad Grandpa</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bad-Grandpa.jpg alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" width=1000 height=562 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,’ often known as ‘Bad Grandpa,’ is a Jeff Tremaine-directed hidden camera comedy film that follows a grandfather and his grandson on an epic road journey full with hysterical misadventures. Through the many pranks and stunts that are a feature of the Jackass franchise, it creates a loosely linear storyline. It has a road trip theme and a hidden camera approach similar to ‘Bad Trip.’ Is there a finer best friend combo than a grandfather and his grandson? No, we don’t believe so.</p><h3>Borat</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Borat.jpg alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" width=768 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Borat’ is likely the most well-known film in the hidden camera comedy subgenre, and it stands up to all of the buzz surrounding it. Larry Charles directed the film, which follows Sacha Baron Cohen’s titular character as he interviews real individuals across America for his documentary. To put it another way, ‘Borat’ is the iceberg of the hidden camera comedy genre, if ‘Bad Trip’ is the tip of the iceberg. The satirical humor in the film is also a step forward from the nearly absurdist humor in ‘Bad Trip.’ In the end, if you liked ‘Bad Trip,’ you should surely watch ‘Borat’ to see the hidden camera comedy genre at its best.</p><h3>Dude, Where’s My Car?</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dude-Where’s-My-Car.jpg alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Dude, Where’s My Car?’ is a stoner comedy film about Jesse and Chester, two best friends who lose Jesse’s car after getting stoned. The key protagonists’ tight friendship is a recurring theme in both this film and ‘Bad Trip.’ The narrative of both flicks revolves around a missing car, and it’s funny to watch Jesse and Chester fumble around town trying to track down their follies from the night before. It has developed cult status over time, making it a must-see for comedy enthusiasts.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u916f11e203d495d65e624a7f8f3111c0><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Movies Like Idiocracy: Must-See Films with Similar Themes</span></a><h2>ALSO READ : <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">35 Best Suspense Movies On Netflix That’ll Keep You Guessing</a></h2><h3>Due Date</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Due-Date.jpg alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Due Date’ is a dark comedy film directed by Todd Phillips about Peter Highman, a prominent architect who is compelled to catch a ride from Atlanta to Los Angeles with wannabe actor Ethan Tremblay to be with his wife, Sarah, for the birth of their kid. Because both films involve a road journey packed with amusing mistakes, the film is similar to ‘Bad Trip.’ The ice and fire combo of Zach Galifianakis’ comic timing and Robert Downey Jr.’s captivating screen presence is simply too entertaining to pass up.</p><h3>Impractical Jokers: The Movie</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Impractical-Jokers-The-Movie.jpg alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" width=980 height=569 sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If you enjoyed the rib-tickling banter between two closest friends in ‘Bad Trip,’ you’ll love a quartet of close pals in ‘Impractical Jokers: The Movie,’ a hidden camera comedy film. Sal, Joe, Murr, and Q, the titular jokers, who are undoubtedly the most well-known faces associated with the genre on television, make their big-screen debut in this picture. The film is jam-packed with the jokers’ trademark impractical hijinks, but in a cinematic format. A road journey is included in the film, and the hidden camera format will remind you of ‘Bad Trip.’</p><h3>Project X</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Project-X.jpg alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" width=1024 height=683 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>‘Project X,’ directed by Nima Nourizadeh, is a comedic thriller about three teens, Thomas, Costa, and J.B, who intend to host a big party that will make them famous among their peers. Their scheme, however, goes tragically wrong. The found-footage format of the film can be compared to the hidden camera format of ‘Bad Trip.’ Furthermore, both films don’t mind occasionally blurring the boundary between comedy and profanity in order to keep the audience laughing.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="movies like bad trip on netflix,movies like bad trip reddit,movies like bad trip and bad grandpa,best comedy movies,bad trip 2,movies like the trip 2021,movies like bad grandpa,comedy movies,movies like bad trip 2020,funny movies like bad trip,movies like borat and bad trip,movies that make you trip,other movies like bad trip,more movies like bad trip,is bad trip a good movie" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
