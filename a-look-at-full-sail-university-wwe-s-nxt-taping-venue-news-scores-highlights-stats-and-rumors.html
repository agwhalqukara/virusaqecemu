This will be where the next crop of WWE Superstars and Divas come from, where future champions and icons will begin their journey to superstardom.</p><p>Once a month those men and women will be honing their craft with the cameras rolling at Full Sail's slick live venue.</p><p>Fans in Orange County, Florida can head down to Winter Park and see these up-and-comers as well as the occasional visit from WWE's big names.</p><p>Full Sail University has both a physical campus and online option depending on one's major. Students on campus will not only get to watch live WWE NXT events, but to be a part of them.</p><p>The WWE and Full Sail partnership offers students in the entertainment-related degree programs hands-on experience at these tapings. Students will shadow WWE crew members and get to assist with WWE's behind-the-scenes needs. &nbsp;</p><p>WWE (as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami Herald</a>) has stated, "Every seat is a good seat, close to the action, and the money from admission is designated toward a scholarship fund for a Full Sail student.”</p><p><span>This synergetic relationship is not only good for business, but good for the NXT program.</span></p><p><span>College kids can generally get rowdy for just about anything and their presence should help boost the energy of these taped shows. Eventually NXT should become an integrated fixture on campus. Students who begin to show up regularly will get to know these wrestlers.</span></p><p><span>The venue itself invites a closeness that will improve the NXT atmosphere.</span></p><p>The Full Sail venue has the tight-knitness of the Hammerstein Ballroom mixed with a modern, glossy feel.</p><p>FCW shows sometimes felt a bit sterile. The venue was too brightly lit with a flat energy.</p><p>NXT's new home energizes the show with better lighting, more intimate seating and an overall more impressive presentation.</p><p>Watch Conor O'Brian and Kenneth Cameron enter the NXT ring as the team, Ascension.</p><p>The ramp and the Titantron are close to the crowd. The Full Sail audience is all but on top of O'Brian and Cameron as they enter.</p><p>Even with a small crowd, there is a bubbling energy throughout the place, especially when The Usos come out and get the fans riled up.</p><p>This energy is likely to grow as Full Sail and NXT continue their relationship, as students and Winter Park-area fans get to know the performers.</p><p>Adrian Neville, Paige, Summer Rae, Kassius Ohno and others will be fine-tuning their skills every month in this building. WWE has an attractive lab where it can watch its future stars grow.</p><p>NXT's tapings are going to look mighty good from here on out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5qaGWCc3nAZqOop5tirrV5xa6jpWWjlratedSnoK%2Bdoqi2tcWMsK6eq12jxbV505qnoqaXYsOmutSe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-fake-mental-patients-fooled-doctors.html><span>←</span><span>When Fake Mental Patients Fooled Doctors</span></a>
