Two days later, Poehler attended the awards show with pal <strong>Brooke Posch</strong>, her Paper Kite Productions partner.</p><p>Poehler opened up about their relationship in her 2014 memoir, Yes Please. “I have a boyfriend who knows how to settle me. He puts his hand on my chest and tells me boring stories,” she wrote. “On one of our first nights together, I woke up apologizing for my snoring and he pulled out two earplugs he had worn to bed so he could hear what I was saying. It was one of the most romantic gestures I have ever seen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJimsV2lvKa0y56pZpmemXqvtcKkZKSqn6G5br%2FPpaCtZZGbwaa%2BjK2uqGWpmq6zv4ydnK2ZmaHAbn6Pamxra2k%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-andrea-bocelli-religion-and-faith-multi-instrumentalist-faith-and-family-details.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Andrea Bocelli Religion And Faith?
