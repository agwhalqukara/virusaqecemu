Illegal immigration and border security, the economy, and Trump’s unproven claims that the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” and “stolen” have been the top issues in the primary battle.</p><p>“I’ve looked at each of the candidates for Governor this year, and there’s no question who is the proven conservative ready to lead on Day One: Karrin Taylor Robson,” the governor said in a video statement. “I’m proud to offer Karrin my complete endorsement.”</p><p><strong>ARIZONA GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE TAYLOR ROBSON LANDS A KEY ENDORSEMENT</strong></p><p>Taylor Robson took to twitter to write “I’m humbled to receive the endorsement of Gov.&nbsp;@DougDucey. I’m honored he trusts me to move the state forward in a bold, conservative direction. As Governor, I will secure the border, fight back against Washington and never stop fighting for Arizonans & their families.”</p><p>Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs is the leading contender for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in the one-time red state that’s become a top general election battleground between the two major parties.</p><p>Ducey incurred the wrath of then-President Trump for certifying now-President Biden’s razor-thin victory in Arizona in the 2020 election. The conservative governor famously publicly silenced a phone call from Trump in December 2020 — as he certified his state’s results.</p><p><strong>CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2022 MIDTERMS POWER RANKINGS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While the governor has long stood by his decision, saying he was “loyal to the Constitution and the law,” Trump has repeatedly slammed Ducey, calling him “one of the worst Governors in America” and a “RINO,” which stands for Republican in Name Only.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/640/320/Doug-Ducey-Karrin-Taylor-Robson.jpg><p>Arizona Gov.
