The four-time NFL MVP had slightly smaller hands at 9.375 inches than Williams. His arm length and wingspan weren't recorded.</p><p>To cite the player whom Williams has been <a href=# rel=noopener>frequently compared</a> to over the past two seasons, Patrick Mahomes checked in at exactly 6'2" and 225 pounds with 33.75-inch arms and 9.25-inch hands in 2017.</p><p>The Athletic's Nate Tice, who has been banging the drum that Drew Brees is a more appropriate comparison for Williams, posted their measurables against each other.</p>Nate Tice <span class=acct>@Nate_Tice</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Caleb Williams&lt;br>H: 6-1 1/8&lt;br>W: 214&lt;br>Arm: 32&lt;br>Hand: 9 3/4&lt;br>&lt;br>Drew Brees&lt;br>H: 6-1&lt;br>W: 213&lt;br>Arm: 31&lt;br>Hand: 10 1/4 &lt;a href="https://t.co/0XEdEusHcF">https://t.co/0XEdEusHcF&lt;/a></p><p>This was the only part of the combine, along with a press conference on Friday, that Williams participated in. He even <a href=# rel=noopener>skipped out</a> on the medical evaluation, though he intends to go through that process during his individual team meetings.</p><p>Williams doesn't really need to do much this weekend. He's been considered arguably the top quarterback in the class since the start of the 2022 college football season.</p><p>Nothing that has happened in the subsequent two years seems to have changed that. Williams is going to hear his name called very early when the 2024 NFL draft begins on April 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWaBcnyMnJilnZJixKq4y6KYpqtdlsFufo9ra2amlqF6pLvMm6CnnV2isqK%2F1Kucpp2eqcButMign6Whl53BtHnAp5tmqpWWsLW1zqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-s-the-good-news-on-olivia-ward-s-twitter.html><span>←</span><span>Whats the Good News on Olivia Wards Twitter?</span></a>
