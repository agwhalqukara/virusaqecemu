In its place, they built the French chateau-style home in 1991. Tori Spelling, 38, lived in the residence until age 19. The home has a double staircase inspired by Gone with the Wind. There's also a flower-cutting room, a china room and a "<strong>Prince Charles</strong> Suite," named after the one-time royal guest.&nbsp;</p><p>The buyer, <strong>Petra Ecclestone</strong>, is a 22-year-old Croatian-English racing heiress.
