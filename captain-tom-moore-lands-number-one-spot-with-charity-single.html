I have to thank Michael Ball, the NHS Voices of Care Choir and everyone behind the scenes, who shared their talents and expertise in order to raise money for the NHS, to whom we owe so much. And, of course, the public for buying the single and donating – we’re in this together, and I am forever grateful for your support. And this just proves ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’”.</p><p>Michael Ball, who also celebrates his first ever UK number one single, added: “This is the most extraordinary thing, one of the proudest moments of my career. But it’s not about me it’s about Captain Tom, thank you for giving him a No.1 on his 100th&nbsp;birthday!”</p><p>All proceeds from the song will be going to <a href=#>NHS Charities Together</a>, marking another milestone in Captain Tom Moore’s inspiring efforts to raise money for the NHS during these difficult times; the veteran has now raised almost £29 million.</p><p>Have you been inspired by Captain Tom Moore?
