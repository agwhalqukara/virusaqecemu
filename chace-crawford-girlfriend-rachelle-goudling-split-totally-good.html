The Gossip Girl hunk delivered the news of his split himself during a Wednesday, July 16 interview with Sydney's The Kyle and Jackie O Show.</p><p>The hosts asked Crawford whether he was still dating "the hot chick." The actor, 28, responded, "Ah, no. I'm not. I'm not."</p><p>"It's totally good… totally good," Crawford said of the split, adding that it was amicable. "We had fun," he concluded.</p><p>The heartthrob, who played Nathaniel Archibald on the popular show (costarring <strong><a href=#>Blake Lively</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Leighton Meester</a></strong>, and more), was first spotted cozying up to Goulding, 27, at a <a href=#>Knicks game</a> in March 2013. At the time, a source told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> that <a href=#>the good-looking pair</a> didn't have "anything serious" going on between them.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Crawford has previously been linked to stars like <strong><a href=#>Ashley Greene</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a></strong>. When asked what qualities he looks for in a potential mate, Crawford told Pop Sugar in April 2012, "I love a girl who's really spontaneous, someone who's up for going on a camping trip, or concert or sporting event."</p><p>With his love life on a temporary hiatus, Crawford said his main focus is currently his film career, including roles in Eloise and Mountain Men. "I am traveling too much right now," <strong><a href=#>Tony Romo</a></strong>'s brother-in-law said. "I am just trying to move in [to my new West Coast pad] and I have a couple of independent films right now."</p><p>The former New York City resident said dating in his new town will also require an adjustment. "L.A. is different," Crawford noted. "It's definitely a different town from New York, especially for meeting people."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhmZOaeqS%2BwLCdqKqUYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6s63CoZylpJVitLDBw6Wgp59dqL2ttdNmq6iskaG5unnGqKadZWJlfnV9lXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-graham-shows-off-her-post-partum-body-in-workout-and-selfie-photos-and-videos.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Graham Shows Off Her Post-Partum Body In Workout And Selfie Photos And Videos</span></a>
