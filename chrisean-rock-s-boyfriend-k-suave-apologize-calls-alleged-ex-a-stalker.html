I was wrong, I should have handled it differently like a man. That’s my fault. There’s no one to blame but me,” K Suave said in the video.</p><p>Chrisean Rock also got some shots as the woman wrote on Instagram Story – “Say what you want about me but I know how to hold a newborn baby neck from dangling upside down.” The woman also posted a video of herself dancing to Jaidyn Alexis’ song “Barbie.”</p><p>In the meantime, K Suave posted a video on the weekend saying that he had been stalked by the woman for more than a year now.</p><p>“She’s back randomly again. You already know how she gets and I’m sorry and yes she’s back. Be prepared for a lot of trite comments and DMs from this b*tch,” he said, adding that he’s never met the woman or seen her. “People are really crazy,” he said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chrisean finally moved on? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IDjr7UyMNW</a></p><p>— Baddies:East (@BaddiesOnZeus) <a href=#>November 19, 2023</a></p><p>Chrisean Rock has not addressed the woman, but Blueface had a comment for the Baddies reality star’s new K Suave nail designs as he mocked her for putting the rapper’s name on her body after they’ve just met.
