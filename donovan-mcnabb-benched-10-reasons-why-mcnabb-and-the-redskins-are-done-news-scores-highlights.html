These two guys are just never going to mesh. No matter what happens at the end of this season, it is just not going to work between these two guys.&nbsp;</p><p>Ranging from the lack of trust, to the fact that Shanahan is on the hot seat in Washington, things just didn't work out. It's a shame to see a QB like McNabb not work out in a team that needs so much help, and it may go down as one of the most failed experiments in NFL history.&nbsp;</p><p>The way this whole thing is going to shake out is, McNabb is going to leave at the end of the season. Even if Shanahan goes before, McNabb will still want to leave. His entire career in Washington has been tainted and there is just no way to recover from something like this.&nbsp;</p><p>With all of the teams interested in McNabb, his career is far from over. It's just done in Washington.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobG1uZWiDbrDOp6avmZ5iuqS6wJuZZpqVo7CpscNmaGllopqutLvNrGSwoKliuqS6wJuZZpmemXq1tMRmqZ6co6C2r7%2BMmqmeZZSku6Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-at-full-sail-university-wwe-s-nxt-taping-venue-news-scores-highlights-stats-and-rumors.html><span>←</span><span>A Look at Full Sail University, WWE's NXT Taping Venue | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</span></a>
