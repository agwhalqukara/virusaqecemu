That’s a question that many people are asking due to an upcoming article in the November 16, 2020, issue of Life & Style Weekly magazine. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quibi</a> was a great idea but unfortunately, it hit at the wrong time. Quibi (stands for Quick Bites) was meant to be entertainment for busy people who are on the go. You know the type…rushing to get out of the house in the morning, grabbing a commuter train so they can make sure they clock in on time. The folks who worked nine-to-fives and then overtime, only to grab dinner and a train at the same time before going home to do it all over again. Quibi would have been perfect for those folks. Only the Coronavirus pandemic hit, and people found themselves home and with hours upon binge-worthy hours on their hands.</p><p>No one wanted to watch a five-minute series — they wanted to catch up on shows like Game of Thrones or binge watch Netflix’s You over and over. And with that, the quickest thing about Quibi was how long it lasted.</p><p>Unfortunately for <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon Stuns In Draper James Dress"><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a> and her hubby Jim Toth, he quit his job at CAA to head up Quibi’s content acquisition and talent (that also included a lucrative $6 million gig for his adorable wife Reese).</p><p>Now, <a href=# title="Is Katie Holmes Secretly Married To Emilio Vitolo Jr.?"><strong>marriage</strong></a> is about good times and bad times. It’s about in sickness and in health and for richer and for poorer, but divorce is about these things too. <strong>Divorce</strong> is about, “Well, that mistake is just one too many and I’m done with these mistakes. Hasta Lavista, baby.”</p><p>So now, the gossip mill is churning the idea that Reese, who is incredibly successful and seems to have a golden touch, is ready to move on due to Jim’s recent Quibi risk that proved to be a failure. Here is what Life & Style quoted a source as saying.</p><p>Leaving his position at CAA to join Quibi was a huge gamble. At the time, Reese asked Jim if it was worth the risk, but he said he was up for the challenge and felt confident he’d bing home million. It’s gone horribly, horribly wrong since then, and now Quibi has shut down. There are rumors that Reese and Jim are headed for a divorce. Tensions are at an all-time high, and friends believe Reese and Jim are at a breaking point — they both want out.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>@mollywood</a> a little Quibi tidbit for you <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/qJuhvTmBlO</a></p><p>— Sondra5000 (@Sondra5000) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 5, 2020</a></p><p>At this point, neither Reese Witherspoon or Jim Toth have responded to divorce rumors or given any indication to the public that their marriage is on the rocks.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=#>Charisse Van Horn</a> is a freelance writer from Tampa Bay.
