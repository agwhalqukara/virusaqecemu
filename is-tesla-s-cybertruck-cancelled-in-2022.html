It is undeniably one of the most elaborate April Fools’ Day pranks pulled by CarBuzz.</p><p>The publication issued a report titled “CANCELED! Tesla Cybertruck Is Dead.” According to the article, Elon himself announced the cancellation of the Cybertruck, saying, “Very sad to say we’ve made the difficult decision to cancel our Cybertruck.”</p><p>“I know there will be a lot of disappointed customers, and all pre-orders will be refunded as soon as possible.” “The decision was made in the best interests of Tesla and its future,” the statement continues.</p><h2>Tesla Yet has Not addressed the Joke</h2><p>Tesla has yet to make an official announcement. Tesla’s Cybertruck is one of its most significant initiatives. Naturally, any news about its production or cancellation would be made public.</p><p>The manufacturer has not responded to Car Buzz’s joke that the Cybertruck’s production plans are “dead.” Furthermore, sources close to the company told Reuters that the production delay is due to “changing features and functions of the electric pickup to make a compelling product” rather than “far exceeding” development costs.</p><h2>Don’t Be Fooled By The April Fools Joke</h2><p>As part of April Fools’, you will come across several obscure claims until the end of the month. As a result, we recommend that you always double-check your sources before believing any breaking news.</p><p>One Twitter user responded to the Tesla Cybertruck prank by writing, “I am ashamed to admit I fell for this April fools!”</p><p>“Carbuzz is reporting Cybertruck has been canceled and will not be released to the public,” another said. Could you please confirm? This will completely devastate me.”</p><p>“I just read an article in Carbuzz magazine that said the Cybertruck had been canceled.” “I don’t believe it,” one person tweeted.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Tesla's Cybertruck</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Tesla's Cybertruck cancelled</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWkmsCtrdJmmrKalafBs8HCpGScmZ6Ysq24xJ1koqZdZ31zfo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danneel-harris-jensen-ackles-baby-girl-picture-meet-justice-jay.html><span>←</span><span>Danneel Harris, Jensen Ackles Baby Girl Picture: Meet Justice Jay</span></a>
