<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Joe Merrick Shared Beautiful Alcremie Wedding Cake Design &amp;amp; People Are Loving It!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The creator of the Pokémon fan website Serebii recently revealed a stunning wedding cake that was based on the dessert-themed Pokémon Alcremie in honour of his impending nuptials. This adorable Fairy-type Pokémon made its debut in the 2019 game Pokémon Sword and Shield, where it evolved from Milcery following a protracted and challenging procedure that required its master to give it a Sweet and strike a posture at a specific time of day. The resulting Alcremie can take on one of nine various forms depending on the hour and how long the Trainer spins around before striking the pose. It also has a Gigantimax form that can be released for a status boost during battle.</p><p>One of the many subjects that players can read about on Serebii, which acts as an online index for the many Pokémon games, anime, movies, and events, is the lengthy and difficult process involved in obtaining an Alcremie. In addition, Serebii has a reputation for publishing announcements and leaks about upcoming Pokémon games, such as November’s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, including the identities of the new starter Pokémon trio. Because of their shared passion for Pokémon, Serebii webmaster Joe Merrick and Serebii team member Marti Bennet decided to model their wedding cake after a suitable Pokémon character after they became engaged.</p><p>Earlier today, Joe Merrick revealed on his Twitter account that the wedding cake is patterned around Alcremie’s Gigantimax form by posting a few images of it. This multi-decker cake was made by the Warrington, England-based Amazing Cake Company to depict the towering, multicoloured appearance of Gigantimax Alcremie. Its top features a nearly perfect sculpture of the main body of the confection-based Fairy Pokémon. Fans have applauded the cake for its accuracy in the comments section of Merrick’s post. Some of Merrick’s coworkers have expressed excitement over the prospect of eating it at the wedding, and others have wished him luck in getting married to Marti Bennet.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Just in case you guys wanted to see, here is our wedding cake by <a href=#>@AmazingCakeCo</a> <a href=#>#SerebiiWedding</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZreQ7kkCLH</a></p><p>— Joe Merrick (@JoeMerrick) <a href=#>July 17, 2022</a></p><p>This Pokémon-themed wedding occurs as Nintendo prepares to release the aforementioned Scarlet and Violet, the next generation of Pokémon, later this year. Despite the fact that Alcremie hasn’t been formally confirmed for these new Pokémon games as of this writing, rumours suggest that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will introduce new variant types that are similar to those that characterise Alcremie’s intricate evolutionary process, although these are rumoured to be based around different time periods rather than specific times of the day. Although official information is currently lacking, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet may also feature a new Pokémon mid-battle transformation gimmick along the lines of the Gigantimax forms that Pokémon like Alcremie can assume.</p><p>The wedding cake being served at Joe Merrick and Marti Bennet’s nuptials is a nearly flawless recreation of the towering dessert-like creature, Gigantimax Alcremie, which seems like the ideal Pokémon to use as inspiration for a wedding cake. Screen Rant sends its best wishes to the newlyweds on their new adventure, which is being heralded by one of the several Pokémon breeds featured on Serebii.net.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
