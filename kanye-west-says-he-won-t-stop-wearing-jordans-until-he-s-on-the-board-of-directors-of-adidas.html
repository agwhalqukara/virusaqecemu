The rapper wrote, “‘I’m not releasing nothing on GAP till I’m on the Board.”</p><p>He said the same thing for Adidas, as well. Fans of Kanye know he has been working with both companies, including Gap,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> which he first announced earlier in the year.</a></p><p>https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1309001892228485121</p><p>According to Hot New Hip Hop, Kanye’s demand to get on the board of directors of GAP may have some teeth to it, considering the rapper has threatened to not release a thing until they give him more authority in the company.</p><p>The outlet claims GAP has been struggling to make sales in recent years, and his contract with them is valued at over $100 million. This comes not long after the rapper put the recording industry on blast for not allowing artists to own their master recordings.</p><p>The issue has already been in the media this year when Taylor Swift accused Scooter Braun of trying to control her career and her persona by buying the rights to all of her albums. Despite their previous drama, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye said he&nbsp;intended on getting her master recordings.</a></p><p>During his interview with Billboard, Kanye said that every artist had the right to own their “rights” and their recordings. Taylor Swift deserves it as well, the rapper argued. Reportedly, Kanye and Scooter Braun are close friends and the Yeezy creator said he and the power manager will be having a conversation about it in the future.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As it was previously reported, Taylor referred to Scooter buying her master recordings as one of the worst things that had ever happened to her.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblru6sYywnKysXaiuur%2BMoZxmr5%2BjwW6%2F06inZq%2BVlr%2BqusZmoaiqlJa7tHnUp6uipF2dsrR5zqdkraCVYq%2BwrdGdZKieXZm2s7HCraarq12ks26tw6KbmqtdaYB6gphtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harrison-ford-and-calista-flockhart-keep-it-casual-in-stroll-around-amherst-after-son-s-graduation.html><span>←</span><span>Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart keep it casual in stroll around Amherst after son's graduation</span></a>
