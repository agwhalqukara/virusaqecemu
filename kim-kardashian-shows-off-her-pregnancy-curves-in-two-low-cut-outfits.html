One of the perks of pregnancy is some serious cleavage—a fact that pregnant Kim Kardashian, who’s expecting a little boy with husband Kanye West, sure doesn’t want you to forget. The reality star, 34, was spotted out and about in Paris on Monday, July 20, and Tuesday, July 21, rocking her enhanced assets in some dangerously plunging necklines.
On Monday night, the raven-haired beauty hit the pavement rocking a semi-sheer La Perla bodysuit with a deep V-neckline (the better to see her ebony bra)."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

As she revealed via Instagram, the second-time mom-to-be met with Balmain’s designer, <strong>Olivier Rousteing</strong>, for a busy evening. “Only in Paris a short time but who else will eat all of my favorite foods with me then have pregnancy wardrobe fittings!!!!” she <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned</a> a photo of herself and the handsome Frenchman, adding the obvious: “@olivier_rousteing of course!!!!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-white-peplum-inline.jpg><p>But there was still more to come. The following day, Kardashian, who’s been really loving her monochromatic looks as of late, switched her palette from all-black to all-white to do a little retail therapy. She was wrapped in an extremely low-cut vest, so deep that you could peep her “hidden” corset-style bra. A stretchy Donna Karan skirt, nude Manolo Blahnik heels, and her beloved Celine shades completed the daring ensemble.</p><p>Which of Kardashian’s Parisian pregnancy styles do you prefer?
