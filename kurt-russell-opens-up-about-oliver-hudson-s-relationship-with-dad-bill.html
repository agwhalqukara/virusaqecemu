I would say to her ‘Goldie, why are you trashing me and saying I’m an absent father when it’s simply not the case?’ and she’d laugh and go ‘Oh Bill, you know it makes for a better story.'”</p><p>Calling Oliver’s message a “dagger to the heart,” Bill also said, “I don’t want to see either of my eldest children ever again.
