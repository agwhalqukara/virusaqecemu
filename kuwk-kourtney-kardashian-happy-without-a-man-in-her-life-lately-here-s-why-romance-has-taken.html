So at this point, her love life really has taken a back seat to everything else. That is not to say that Kourtney would not be open to romance or that she’s trying to remain closed off to a potential opportunity,’ the source dished.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>They added that: ‘She spends so much time with her kids and working, and she is not going out every night and meeting men. She is a huge believer in fate and feels that if the right person is out there then they will find each other when the time is right. But for now Kourtney is feeling completely fulfilled and does not think she is missing out on anything just because she is not in a committed relationship.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsSsecqorKusnprGbrfAq5uaq5ierq95x5qnqbFdrLa1tM6uq2aZXaKur3nIp2ShnaJiuaqyxGajmqyVocZutMSrnKxlp53Gbr7Oppinm5VitaK%2FjK2YpJ2eYq5ursCcomarlZbBbn%2BQbHBwcV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-types-of-neighbours-every-south-african-would-love-to-have.html><span>←</span><span>10 Types Of Neighbours Every South African Would Love To Have</span></a>
