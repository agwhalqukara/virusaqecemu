They’re getting to know each other more and this has been a really nice test to their relationship that they are embracing and learning from day by day. She seems pretty happy and chill right now.’</p><p>Last month, the singer shared a super cute snap that showed her and Michael getting cozy with one another.</p><p>It showed her in a glam, black dress, wearing her hair up and holding hands with her man – so sweet!</p><p>A second insider told the same news outlet that ‘It was an easy decision to self quarantine together because Gaga and Michael had already been inseparable before the stay at home order even began. Although they have been dating only for a few months, they obviously have such a strong connection. They love spending as much time together as they can so although this quarantine is not to be taken lightly and they’re doing their part to flatten the curve, they feel very lucky to have each other to lean on for support during a time like this.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B93JykxFPBz/</p><p>Previously, another source told the site that she is really serious about Michael and that he is definitely a lot more than just a fling.</p><p>Not only that but they mentioned that she’d introduced him to her loved ones already and they all approved.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Is he really the one for Gaga?
