Lea is embroiled in a huge controversy after being accused by Samantha Ware of inappropriate behavior.</p><p>Fans were probably commenting on Lea‘s page about the fact that her Glee co-star, Naya Rivera, has been missing after boating with her son, Josey, at Lake Piru in California.</p><p>Fans pointed out that July 13 marks the 7th anniversary of Lea‘s late boyfriend, Cory Monteith‘s tragic death due to heroin and alcohol.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAdU17-lCF-/</p><p>Talking to Variety, Samantha had this to say about Lea: “I knew from day one when I attempted to introduce myself. There was nothing gradual about it. As soon as she decided that she didn’t like me, it was very evident. It was after I did my first performance, that’s when it started – the silent treatment, the stare-downs, the looks, the comments under her breath, the weird passive-aggressiveness. It all built up.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAI5b4_gWkb/</p><p>She went on to explain: “Lea’s actions were nothing new, so I guess since it was such a common thing, my case didn’t seem like that big of a deal. I remember the first day I actually spoke up, and unfortunately, no one did anything. They just shrugged it off, like ‘That’s her.’ No one was stopping these things, which is an issue because the environment was helping perpetuate this abuse.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8wtGG_F3vX/</p><p>She also revealed: “She waited until the scene was over and she stopped in the middle of the stage and did a ‘come here’ gesture, like how a mother does to their child. You need to come here right now. I said ‘no,’ and that’s when she decided to threaten my job and said she would call Ryan Murphy in to come and fire me. It’s scary. For the full week, I was thinking I’m probably going to get an email, and I might not be able to do the last three episodes, or I might not be able to sing another song.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lea is currently pregnant, and she is probably taking a break to avoid stress and mean comments.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecmq5uucicn56klWKxprjErZysZZiav26%2FzpygmqRdorKltcBmmJybn6q7tXnAp5tmrJiewG65yKCfrWWSmnq1tMRmqZ6Zo6S7bq7EoaCnnF2dsrN50q6pqaqZqLavs4ympq%2BdXWl%2BdoGXcGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./klay-thompson-rumors-mavs-pushing-extremely-hard-for-warriors-fa-amid-lakers-buzz-news-scores.html><span>←</span><span>Klay Thompson Rumors: Mavs Pushing 'Extremely Hard' for Warriors FA amid Lakers Buzz | News, Scores,</span></a>
