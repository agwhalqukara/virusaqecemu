This means she might learn about the new experimental treatment that he’s been using to save Eric’s life.</p><p>Some fans wonder if this treatment will even work. This was brought up on the SoapCentral.com Message Boards.</p><p>One B&B fan asked: “What’s Li worried about now? He’s trying to help Eric… Guess he doesn’t tell her.”</p><p>Another user responded: “I agree that Finn must be keeping his medical research a secret from Li.”</p><p>A third user noted: “Li seems like a very controlling person. Finn not having her in the loop will drive her crazy. She will but I’m sure.”</p><p><img alt='The Bold And The Beautiful: Li Finnegan (Naomi Matsuda) and Dr. John "Finn" Finnegan&#39;s (Tanner Novlan)' width=730 height=426 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/12/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-spoilers-li-concerned-about-finns-medical-research/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Li Concerned About Finn’s Medical Research" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/BB-Lee-and-Finn-2.jpg></p><p><a href=#>According to the Bold and the Beautiful spoilers,</a> Finn kept his medical research a secret from Li. He didn’t want to concern her about the situation involving Eric.</p><p>Also, Eric doesn’t want everyone to know that he’s dying. However, most of the Logans and the Forresters know what’s going on with him.</p><h3>The Bold And The Beautiful Spoilers: Li Turns On Finn</h3><p><a href=#>The spoilers could also suggest that Li will eventually turn on Finn</a>. She might be upset when she learns he’s been playing around with this new treatment option behind her back.</p><p>She could argue that Finn should’ve come to her first. On the flip side, Li could be concerned that Finn is researching DNA.</p><p>She might become paranoid because Li and her sister Poppy (Romy Park) are hiding something from him. There are still questions among B&B fans as to why Li doesn’t like her sister Li.</p><p>She teased that Poppy was a wild and carefree woman who had an affair with an established doctor. However, those details haven’t come to light as of yet.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Finn’s medical research? Do you agree with Li having her concerns? Do you think this experimental treatment could impact Eric’s health?
