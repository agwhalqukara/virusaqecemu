Newly single, <strong>Lindsey Vonn</strong> stepped out on Tuesday, May 5, and looked better than ever after splitting from <strong>Tiger Woods</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The champion skier, 30, appeared at a media event in Seoul, South Korea just three days after she confirmed that she was parting ways with the famed golfer, 39. “After nearly three years together, Tiger and I have mutually decided to end our relationship,” <a href=#>she wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday, May 3</a>. “I will always cherish the memories that we’ve created together.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Unfortunately, we both lead incredibly hectic lives that force us to spend a majority of our time apart,” Vonn added in her post. “I will always admire and respect Tiger. He and his beautiful family will always hold a special place in my heart.”</p><p>Those words were the last Vonn said on the subject, dodging questions about her ex-boyfriend as she appeared happy and energetic at the event in support of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games. Vonn, who took home a gold medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics, was celebrated at the anticipatory affair with an honorary ambassador title.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Vonn attempted to focus the attention on her athletic career, rather than her recent split, telling reporters when asked about Woods, “I don’t really want to talk about my personal life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think I said everything in my Facebook post,” <a href=#>she reportedly added at the press conference</a>. “I will just leave it at that.”</p><p>While the celebrated skier is attempting to happily move on with her life without Woods, the former Masters champion isn’t quite following suit. “It does affect me,” <a href=#>he told reporters before The 2015 Players Championship of the hard time in his personal life</a>. “It is tough, there’s no doubt. I’m not gonna lie about that, it is tough.”</p><p>“On top of that, this time of year is really, really hard on me,” Woods added, referencing the anniversary of his father’s death, which took place on May 3, 2006. “This three-day window is really hard. I haven’t slept. These three days, May 3rd and through the 5th, today, are just brutal on me. Obviously with what happened on Sunday, it just adds to it.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOippSosrp51ailp2WcpLysv4ybnK2slad6tbTAp2SerpWneqKy056pZqyZnLKzedaopp2rXai9rbXTZqehp6SkwG5%2Bj2psb20%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kellen-moore-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Kellen Moore Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
