On Wednesday night, <a href=#>Kyle Richards</a> said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen that the news of the restaurant’s closing doesn’t come as a surprise.</p><p>“I mean all of the restaurants are so hard hit in Los Angeles, it didn’t really surprise me at all,” said Richards.</p><p>When the pandemic prompted California officials to shut down non-essential businesses, Villa Blanca shared via Instagram on March 16 that they would be “closing until further notice.”</p><p>“These are scary times right now, but nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees and guests,” the eatery wrote. “Together we will get through this and come out stronger on the other side.”</p><p>They also encouraged everyone to practice social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the community. And, they told fans to keep following their page for updates.</p><p>In addition to Villa Blanca, Vanderpump also owns SUR, Tom Tom, and Pump in West Hollywood, as well as the Vanderpump Cocktail Garden in Las Vegas. LVP admitted in April during an appearance on WWHL that having to close her restaurants during the pandemic has “been devastating.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9z98XNp_K9/</p><p>“It’s not just our business; it’s our life as well. So many people have worked for us for years. Now they’re all on unemployment,” said Vanderpump. “Just everything’s gone right now. We can’t go in there, I can’t see what’s going on. It’s been devastating. It’s been really sad, I have to say.”</p><p>In addition to the loss of business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Villa Blanca had already been facing financial troubles after Ken Todd and Lisa Vanderpump lost a sexual discrimination lawsuit in 2014 brought on by a former waitress.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>According to Tamara Tattles, after losing the court battle, Villa Blanca went bankrupt. And, Todd and Vanderpump have been looking to get rid of the restaurant for years.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecnsCiedWapZ2doqXCrryMoZisZaCav66tzZ6lraSpYrCtu9Kem2annpp6sLKMoZyrZZaWuqawjKucrKyRqr%2BiutOsZJ%2BdkanCs7HDZqanZaKdvKO0jJqkopxdmLy3tcNmaHJloJa7pbHMoppmbGFphHJ9jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-reason-why-we-shouldn-t-2-wds.html><span>←</span><span>I ___ reason why we shouldn't: 2 wds.</span></a>
