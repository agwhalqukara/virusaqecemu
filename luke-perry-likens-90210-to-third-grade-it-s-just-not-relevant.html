Luke Perry, who shot to fame as bad boy Dylan McKay in the hugely popular ’90s show Beverly Hills, 90210, does not want to talk about it at all!
The 48-year-old actor was questioned about whether he would be tuning in to watch Lifetime’s Unauthorized Beverly Hills, 90210 Tell-All during an appearance at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Thursday, July 30. But far from feeling warm and nostalgic about the show which catapulted him and fellow stars Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Shannen Doherty, Ian Ziering, and Jason Priestley to fame, Perry made it very clear he wanted to put his 90210 days behind him."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But far from feeling warm and nostalgic about the show which catapulted him and fellow stars <strong>Jennie Garth</strong>, <strong><a href=#>Tori Spelling</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Shannen Doherty</a></strong>, <strong>Ian Ziering</strong>, and <strong>Jason Priestley</strong> to fame, Perry made it very clear he wanted to put his 90210 days behind him.</p><p>“What do you think about Lifetime doing the tell-all?” the actor was asked.</p><p>“I don’t think about it,” he replied.</p><p>“You must have some thoughts?” the reporter continued.</p><p>“No,” replied Perry, definitively.</p><p>“Why do you think there’s still a fascination? It’s been a few years since that show went off the air,” someone else persisted.</p><p>“Yeah, I had really cool hair,” Perry quipped, dryly.</p><p>“Why are you so disconnected from that? Why does it not matter to you?” the reporters went on.</p><p>“Third grade,” Perry replied flatly. “How much does that matter to you? Exactly. It’s just not relevant to anything I’m doing. Next question?”</p><p>While evidently keen to distance himself from the show that made him a teen heartthrob, Perry did admit to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> a little later, that he does understand the connection fans had to the show, and is happy to discuss that on a one-on-one level.</p><p>“When it’s between two people, right? And it’s you and I, we’re having a talk about it, that’s great and that’s never lost on me. It’s always very flattering and I like it,” he said. “When I meet somebody and I can see that they appreciated the work and they want to talk about the show, I’m always happy to do that,” he admitted.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>But tuning in to watch the Lifetime 90210 Tell-All?
