Apparently, the main cause for all the controversy was the fact that the message congratulating the young boy for his birthday did not make any reference to his actual name."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Wishing you a very special day and lots of love!‚Äù</p><p>According to some, this was a show of disrespect for the future King of the nation. And while some initially assumed that this would blow over quickly, it did not seem to.</p><p>On the contrary, the controversy went on for quite a while, with many people jumping in the comment section to express their disappointment.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz3JmeTlcpN/</p><p>Others were critical of those comments themselves, claiming that people were blowing a small situation way out of proportion and that everyone should calm down.</p><p>A person bashed Harry and Meghan by saying: ‚ÄúIt is HRH.FUTURE King. he‚Äôs someone you will bow and curtsy to in future.‚Äù</p><p>Another commenter replied: ‚ÄúIt is so funny that everyone thinks that it was Meghan wrote the post. Would there be all this negativity if Harry wrote it after all it is there page? Do you think when there together they talk to each other using their titles.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0MapAylN3g/</p><p>This person added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfortunate that so-called royal fans who don‚Äôt have much going on in their own lives have now taken it upon themselves to post vile and disrespectful comments on social media pages to make themselves feel important and relevant. It is sad that the simple act of wishing children of the British Royal Family a Happy Birthday has now deteriorated into the posting of vile and disrespectful comments. People need to get a grip on themselves and find something productive to do with their time.üôèüèΩ‚Äù</p><p>This Instagram user shared: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm anti-royal. Ppl will visit England for past culture. They don‚Äôt need to pay royals $500million. But..it‚Äôs getting ridiculous to bash someone who‚Äôs sending ‚Äúwell wishes.‚Äù</p><p>It does not look like the royal family itself is affected negatively by the whole ordeal in any way, so there is at least that.</p><p>In the meantime, Meghan and Prince have not provided any further comments on the situation.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0MandYlEtw/</p><p>This is not the first time they have been the subject of heavy criticism for their actions though. All in all, it looks like many people have it out for the couple for some reason, although it is not clear why exactly.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What are your thoughts on this odd scandal?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedmrSprc1mpJqqm6Gybq3NnWSpqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7Fdlr%2BmedKlmKallZl6p7vRZq6roaSeu6h51qGYrWWTp7a1tcKsZJyZnKF6onnDoqqrnaOlsqTAxa6jZqWVqMCis8RmnaiqXaW%2FqrrCnmSgnZ%2BntKa%2FjJugq6yYma66eZJpbG1taGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-times-soft-mineral-crossword-clue-4-letters-answer.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>LA Times Soft mineral Crossword Clue 4 letters Answer</span></a>
