The Mavs star is one of the game's best scorers despite possessing non-elite athleticism, using dribble moves, unique body twitches and basketball IQ to get by his defenders or draw contact. He also stands three inches shorter than Durant, which gives the Suns All-Star an advantage.</p><p>Durant is one of the game's most gifted scorers in his own right, able to get anywhere on the floor for borderline uncontestable pull-up jumpers thanks to his size and dribble moves—an area where he has vastly improved his game over the course of his career.</p><p>The actual answer to this question is a strong debate, but we at least have an answer from one high-quality defender who has played against both players.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2uCcnyMp5ytq12itqyty2aZq6GUnLK0edKasKxlnZbDtHnLrqKaZZSku6S1wmafmqtdlnqlscSpnKtlkpa0bsDHmqVmq6WjwG63xK%2Bgp2WUqr%2BiutM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lisa-milne-children-and-family-archives.html><span>←</span><span>Lisa Milne Children And Family Archives</span></a>
