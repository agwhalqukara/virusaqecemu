The pregnant Astronaut Wives Club actress and her actor hubby teased the news on Saturday, but wanted to officially reveal their baby's gender on Father's Day.</p><p>Odette and the Red Band Society alum had friendly bets with their friends on whether they were "Team Boy" or "Team Girl." The parents-to-be finally revealed pink confetti as they popped balloons in a sweet video, which was recorded at Odette's 30th birthday party.&nbsp;</p><p>"Who ya got? #teamboy or #teamgirl? #babyannable Gonna post the gender reveal video tomorrow, for my first #fathersday. @odetteannable, let's do this!" Dave, 35, wrote on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>He added in a photo: "Sneak Peek on the moment of truth. Inside info. Almost popped the damn thing getting it out of the car. Try to explain that to a pregnant cuban."</p><p>The actress, 30, and Brothers & Sisters alum married in October 2010. "When we went on a date, I thought, 'Well, I gotta lock this up.' I know I traded up in that deal!" Dave told Us Weekly in 2014. "I'll always be that guy in high school who got shot down for every dance." The couple, fittingly enough, announced on Mother's Day that they are expecting their first child together.</p><p>Watch the cute video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKadnaSpsm6tzZ1knZmmmnqius2amaWdXZa7r7vUp5qeZZKWr7p5xp6lnZ2iYravedWim56nXayuta%2FHZmlpaWVnfnc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./linoleum-covered-like-many-bathroom-floors.html><span>←</span><span>Linoleum-covered like many bathroom floors</span></a>
