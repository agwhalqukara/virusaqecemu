We still can’t believe WMYB came out 7 years ago. Fun fact: the beach where&nbsp;What Makes You Beautiful&nbsp;was filmed was also the same beach featured in Blink 182’s&nbsp;All The Small Things.&nbsp;The beach is located in Malibu, California.</p><p>WMYB&nbsp;was the first single off their debut album, Up All Night.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/one-directions-what-makes-you-beautiful-passes-1-billion-views-on-youtube-01.jpg alt width=1500 height=1500 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>From 2011-2015, the boys have been working and touring nonstop, which is why we have five albums from the guys. 2015 was also the year that Zayn had departed from the band, also the year they announced they were going on a hiatus after their “On The Road Again Tour”.</p><p>From then to now, we have gotten solo work from the four boys. Niall and Harry had been touring since late last year. Louis is a judge on the reality TV show,&nbsp;The X Factor, and also working on new music and Liam has been working hard on his album that should be released soon.</p><p>Stream their most recent album, released in 2015,&nbsp;Made In The A.M.&nbsp;now. It features hit singles such as&nbsp;Drag Me Down&nbsp;and&nbsp;Perfect.</p><p>Each of the boys have made it clear numerous times that they will reunite as One Direction one day. We can’t wait for them to return.</p><p><strong>What is your favorite One Direction song? Do you think the boys will get back together in the future?
