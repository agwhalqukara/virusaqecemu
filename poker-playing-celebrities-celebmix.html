He’s rumoured to have amassed poker winnings of $270,000 over the years as well as hosting poker evenings at home for other mega-stars like Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio.</span></p><h3><span>Jennifer Tilly</span></h3><p><span>An Oscar’s not the only major award that Jennifer Tilly has won. In 2005 she picked up a highly coveted WSOP bracelet when she beat off 600 other competitors to win the Ladies Texas No Limit Hold’em event. It’s thought her poker career earnings to date are over $450,000 – though since 2008 she’s withdrawn from playing quite so much.</span></p><h3><span>James Woods</span></h3><p><span>Woods has had roles in films like Casino and The Gambler so this may be where he got a taste for poker – or his expertise may have been why he was cast. Anyway, over a long and successful playing career he’s won a considerable amount and continues to be a familiar face in both Vegas and Atlantic City Casinos.</span></p><h3><span>Rafa Nadal</span></h3><p><span>His recent tennis career may have been </span><a href=#><span>dogged by injury</span></a><span> but bad knees haven’t prevented Nadal from doing very well at the table. In fact it has been in his may lay-offs from the court that he’s been said to have perfected his game.</span></p><h3><span>Michael Phelps</span></h3><p>The most awarded Olympian of all time is equally at home round the poker table as he is in the pool and rumours of big wins abound – although he’s not one to let on whether these are true. The fact that many of his friends are major poker professionals may give us a hint though.</p><p><span>As to why there’s such a close link between poker and the famous, perhaps for actors it allows them to use all their professional skills for successful </span><a href=#><span>bluffing</span></a><span> while, for sports people, it could well appeal to their hyper-competitive natures.</span></p><p><span>So just don’t get caught trying to get the better of one yourself next time there’s a megastar at the table!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kvbC3xKtkqaSRrravs4ycnKWdkqe2tbXErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nyt-crossword-answers-for-august-19-2023.html><span>←</span><span>NYT Crossword Answers for August 19 2023</span></a>
