There is also a widening revenue gap between the ACC and other conferences, which is making the conference's elite schools want out.</p><p>Florida State has already called a special board of trustees meeting for Friday, reportedly to discuss the school's long-term athletic future, according to ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Andrea Adelson</a>.</p><p>If the SEC doesn't want to add the Seminoles, Hurricanes or Tigers, it's likely that all three schools will continue to weigh their options in pursuit of a more desirable home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGd9d3yMq5ypp6KperSxwmafmqtdoryzsYyop6mno57BqrvNZquhmZ5itq%2FAxKucrKxdnrturcOdoKefXZvAtnnMopimoV2Yuaa50qil</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natural-beauty-stars-without-makeup.html><span>←</span><span>Natural Beauty: Stars Without Makeup</span></a>
