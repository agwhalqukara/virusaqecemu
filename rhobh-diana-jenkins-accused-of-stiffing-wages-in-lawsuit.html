She was paid $25 per hour. Maricela worked for the socialite from 2015 until she too was terminated in 2017.</p><p>The trio claimed they demanded their dues, but Diana refused.</p><p>The lawsuit claims, “Both Santana and Salazar, throughout their employment with [Jenkins] were required to work 8 and 9 consecutive workdays per extended workweek period.” Further, they claimed Diana did not pay them overtime wages earned after working more than 40 hours in a work week.</p><p>On top of that, Griselda and Maricela claim Diana’s chief supervisors told them that they could not take a “10-minute break” for rest — they could only take one daily hour break for lunch.</p><p>“Any time attempted to be taken by Salazar or Santana as a rest break, either before or after the lunch break was interfered with by either supervisor and aggressively denied,” the suit continued.</p><p>The two women also claimed they were harassed and yelled at, and they were searched for any time they were out of sight or deemed to not be working enough.</p><p>When Griselda and Maricela brought up the harsh treatment to Diana, she allegedly and bluntly responded, “This is how we do it in Bosnia.”</p><p>The third defendant, Jorge Ramirez, worked as Diana’s gardener for years — from 2006 to 2014 to be exact. He eventually left, but he returned to work under Diana from 2016 to 2017.</p><p>Jorge also accused Diana of not providing proper rest breaks and unpaid wages.</p><p>Jorge sought $40K for unpaid wages and penalties, Griselda sought $50K, and Maricela demanded upwards of $12K.</p><p>Diana denied all allegations and any wrongdoing.</p><p>The case was eventually dismissed months later.</p><p>Fans already have it out for Diana. How many more skeletons are waiting in the closet for the <a href=#><strong>RHOBH</strong> </a>star?</p><p>Along with the aforementioned lawsuits described above, in another past lawsuit, Diana was accused of calling the police on a Black security guard during a “dispute.”</p><p>As Diana said of herself in this week’s <a href=#><strong>RHOBH</strong> </a>episode, “If you wanted a new villain, here I am.” It’s starting to sound like those words might actually be literal.</p><p><a href=#><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong> </a>airs Wednesday nights at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnop28o7SMrJyaq5%2BjenJ%2BjKecsJqZmnqltcCnmGailaO4qrrSZpicm6WosqV5zp9km52Zo7RuvsCcoKysXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hey-rosetta-energizes-audiences-celebmix.html><span>←</span><span>Hey Rosetta!
