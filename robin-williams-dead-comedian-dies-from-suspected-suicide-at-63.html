<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Robin Williams Dead: Comedian Dies From Suspected Suicide at 63</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Robin Williams</strong>, beloved comedian and Oscar winning actor, died Monday, Aug. 11, his publicist <strong>Mara Buxbaum</strong> confirms to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>. He was 63.</p><p>"Robin Williams passed away this morning," the statement from Buxbaum read. "He has been battling severe depression of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time."</p><p>Williams' wife<strong> Susan Schneider</strong> also told<strong> Us </strong>in a statement: "This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken. On behalf of Robin's family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions." (The comic <a href=#>married</a> third wife, graphic designer Schneider in October 2011.)</p><p>According to the Marin County Sheriff's Office, Williams was found unconscious inside his home in Tiburon, Calif., on Monday afternoon. "At this time, the Sheriff’s Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made," the Sheriff's Department said in its statement. "A forensic examination is currently scheduled for August 12, 2014 with subsequent toxicology testing to be conducted."</p><p>Just last month, Williams, who previously struggled with addiction for years, <a href=#>checked into a renewal facility</a>. An insider told <strong>Us</strong> that his time at the facility had been planned "for a long period of time" and was "not a last minute decision."</p><p>Williams has been vocal about his personal battle with drug addiction. In 2006, the actor checked into rehab for an alcohol-related issue. His rep told <strong>Us </strong>that the actor's decision to check into the facility in July was not due to a relapse. "After working back-to-back projects, Robin is simply taking the opportunity to fine-tune and focus on his continued commitment, of which he remains extremely proud," his rep said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The late actor leaves behind an illustrious career and deep impact on the comedy world. Williams was beloved for his memorable roles in flicks like 1989's Dead Poets Society, 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire, 1991's Hook, 1995's Jumanji, 1997's Flubber and 1998's Patch Adams. He won a Best Suporting Oscar for his role as Sean Maguire in 1997 drama Good Will Hunting.</p><p>Most recently, the actor starred in CBS sitcom The Crazy Ones opposite <strong><a href=#>Sarah Michelle Gellar</a></strong>.</p><p>Williams leaves behind his wife Susan and three children: son&nbsp;<strong>Zachary </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>with first wife <strong>Valerie</strong><strong>)&nbsp;</strong>and daughter<strong> </strong><strong>Zelda </strong>and </strong><strong>son <strong>Cody </strong><strong>(</strong></strong><strong>with second wife <strong>Marsha</strong></strong>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmompmjeri1y6WgmqWjYrGmrcNmmqillZm2orqMnaCeq12bv7C5jJqnqZmimru1edKuoJyhlJp6osCMb2pmamBmgXJ9lw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luana-vjollca-controversy-and-scandal-what-did-she-do-leaked-viral-video.html><span>←</span><span>Luana Vjollca Controversy And Scandal: What Did She Do?
