The celebrity chef underwent a <a href=#>double mastectomy</a> to treat <a href=#>breast cancer back</a> in May.</p><p>“I was early stage and what the beautiful thing is about early stage cancer is it gives you every option in the world, and that is what I took. My doctors have said that I am cancer free and that I am ready to go,” Lee, 49, told GMA‘s<strong> Robin Roberts</strong>.</p><p>“The researchers and the doctors and the nurses and the other warriors, not just breast cancer for all cancer, that came before us, sacrificed their lives so that we could have early detection,” she added. “It’s only respectful to ourselves and to their work and what they gave up for us to get our tushies in there and get it diagnosed and then cut it out and take care of it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lee — who’s been dating New York State Governor<strong> Andrew Cuomo</strong> since 2005 — revealed on May 12 that she was battling cancer. She was <a href=#>hospitalized with an infection</a> after having surgery, but finally returned home in August. On Sunday night, she looked happier than ever in a low-cut Thierry Mugler pink dress at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I couldn’t wear it because I was a little bit too big on top, then I turned my mess, as you say, into my message and I got to wear that plunging dress,” she told Roberts. “I just want to say it doesn’t matter if you’re a DD, which I was, or an A, which I am. Women are not just about their boobs, which is a statement I was making when I wore that dress.”&nbsp;</p><p>She continued: “I don’t even know how I feel anymore. I feel so young and liberated.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqappSnrm64xJ5kq52mmq6tv4ysn56rXZiur6%2FEq2SfqpWaeqp5xZ6cpWWjpHq6u9SnnmaZnpl6rbXBnqmarJWZenN8kG5pa3E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nets-mikal-bridges-says-mavs-luka-don%C4%8Di%C4%87-has-a-deeper-bag-than-suns-kevin-durant-news-scor.html><span>←</span><span>Nets' Mikal Bridges Says Mavs' Luka Doni Has a 'Deeper Bag' Than Suns' Kevin Durant | News, Scor</span></a>
