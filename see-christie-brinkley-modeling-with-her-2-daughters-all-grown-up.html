Brinkley and her daughters, <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Sailor Brinkley-Cook</a></strong> and <strong>Alexa Ray Joel</strong>, recently modeled together in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mother's Day fashion campaign for NYDJ</a>, formerly known as Not Your Daughter's Jeans. Keep reading to see the supermodel and her daughters posing together, and for more on another model's kid, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Heidi Klum's Adorable Selfie With Lookalike Daughter Leni</a>.</p><p>Read the original article on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Best Life</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/christie-brinkley-daughters-nydj.jpg><p>NYDJ partnered with Brinkley and her two daughters for a new campaign ahead of Mother's Day. Joel is Brinkley's 35-year-old daughter with singer-songwriter <strong>Billy Joel&nbsp;</strong>and 22-year-old Brinkley-Cook is Brinkley's daughter with <strong>Peter Cook</strong>. (Brinkley also has a 25-year-old son—<strong>Jack Brinkley</strong>—with <strong>Richard Taubman</strong>.)<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>A behind-the-scenes video of the shoot shows the happy trio getting ready in their dressing room and modeling different outfits, including matching denim and white blouses. "It's really fun. I mean, it makes it not as intimidating when you go to work," Sailor told&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>working with her mom and sister</a> on the NYDJ set. "It makes it sort of more fun and free and comfortable, because we're all laughing at each other and not taking each other as seriously."</p><p>"I love working with them," Brinkley added. "I love doing anything with them."</p><p>Brinkley also, of course, taught her daughters how to pose. "We all do—as I guess Mom taught us—tricks at the posing, the laughing thing," Joel said. "So when we smile, to smile naturally, we all giggle a little bit."</p><p>And for a famous mother-granddaughter duo posing together, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Suzanne Somers' Rare Photo of Her Granddaughter Looking Like Her Twin</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/christie-brinkley-nydj.jpg><p>While on the NYDJ set, Brinkley shared the one thing she always tells her daughters. "Bloom where you're planted," she said. "No matter what's going on in your life, there's always something that you can appreciate about it."</p><p>The mother-of-three also said in the video that she's tried to instill in them that beauty only lasts if it comes from within. "If beauty doesn't start in your heart and soul and include kindness, then it's not lasting beauty," she said.</p><p>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/sailor-christie-brinkley-nydj.jpg><p>Joel said that to her, "beauty is being creative." "It's about freedom of expression," she explained. "My mom really does have that Bohemian spirit that she imparted to me and my siblings."</p><p>Brinkley-Cook, a model like her mom who's appeared in Teen Vogue, Marie Claire, and Sports Illustrated, said her mom has taught her that beauty is about how you feel, not how you look. "She doesn't need to, like, get on a face of makeup and full outfit," Sailor told Entertainment Tonight. "It's not always glam."</p><p>She continued: "With supermodels, you think that they're constantly stressed about how they look, and I think with my mom, it just comes really naturally to her. Like if she feels good, she's gonna look good. She focuses on feeling good, which is definitely important."</p><p>And for more on kids who grew up with their mom in the spotlight, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See What Julia Roberts' 3 Kids Look Like as Teenagers</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/alexa-ray-joel.jpg><p>Joel told&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;that Brinkley is also a woman of many more talents than just modeling.</p><p>"She's an incredible painter!" she said. "People don't realize&nbsp;she's really a renaissance woman. She's multi-talented. She has beautiful penmanship as well.&nbsp;Like, I actually tried to copy&nbsp;her cursive because it's so good. She's very, very, very artistic, and she instilled that in me."</p><p>And for more on the children of A-listers, check out <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>19 Celebrity Kids on Their First Red Carpet</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmnKCinsC1tcRmmauhnqC5psWMnZiun5ipsrO%2FjKecsKtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-m-not-in-the-mood-for-that.html><span>←</span><span>I'm not in the mood for that</span></a>
