As soon as she say, ‘Baby, I’m not feeling it no more,’ oh, it’s gone.”</p><p>The “Family Feud” host revealed a few weeks ago that <a href=#>Marjorie does indeed love her husband’s beard transformation,</a> and it looks like he doesn’t plan on getting rid of it anytime soon.</p><p>Harvey is definitely feeling his salt-and-pepper beard and told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a>, “Every now and then I reinvent myself. … I grew a beard out, but last year it wasn’t enough gray in the mustache yet, but this year when I didn’t color it, it was a lot more gray.
