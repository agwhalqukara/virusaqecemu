It should bring the Suns to <a href=# rel=noopener>approximately</a> $191 million in active roster cap commitments, a massive number that is going to cost them well over $50 million in luxury taxes.</p><p>But Gordon is a solid addition. The 34-year-old averaged 12.4 points per game last season for the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers, shooting 37.1 percent from three. He particularly thrived in his 22 games with the Clippers, hitting on 42.3 percent of his shots from beyond the arc.</p>Shane Young <span class=acct>@YoungNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>It made up 41% of his offense, much higher than any of his Rockets seasons. Meaning, he was finally in a role that could be considered perfect for him — and back with a coach that utilized him &amp;amp; his threat pretty damn well.</p><p>There's little doubt that the Suns are top heavy. A starting lineup that features Durant, Booker, Beal and Ayton isn't going to have much wiggle room to add complementary pieces on anything other than the minimum.</p><p>But Gordon will add additional floor spacing and a veteran presence that has gone through plenty of postseason battles. Getting him on a veteran minimum is very good business for a team with legitimate depth concerns.</p>Dan Feldman <span class=acct>@DanFeldmanNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eric Gordon signed a *max* offer sheet with the Suns in 2012.&lt;br>&lt;br>Gordon is signing a *minimum* contract with the Suns in 2023.&lt;br>&lt;br>The difference in salaries is just $10,472,302.</p><p>Gordon's signing isn't the sort of move that takes Phoenix over the top. Either the trio of Durant, Booker and Beal learns to coexist with just one ball between them and this top-heavy experiment obliterates opposing teams with the sheer amount of offensive firepower on display, or ego and overlapping skill sets causes it to fail miserably.</p><p>There likely isn't much of a middle ground here, and Gordon's addition doesn't really change that math.</p><p>But it does give them more quality and trustworthy depth and a bit of insurance in case one of their big stars gets hurt. In that regard, it was a savvy signing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGaBeH6MrKynq12htq%2Bx1KlkrJmclr%2B6ecKap2aZlqmys3nEq6CcZZekv6W7zaxknKeeqb%2Bir9Nmq6hlmqS2r3nDrqmapqRir6aty2aZqKebmr8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-jonas-looks-unrecognizable-with-giant-beard-on-scream-queens-set.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Jonas Looks Unrecognizable With Giant Beard on Scream Queens Set</span></a>
