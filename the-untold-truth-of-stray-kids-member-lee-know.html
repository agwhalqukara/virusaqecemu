He is a vocalist, rapper and dancer, best known for being a member of the K-pop boy group Stray Kids. The group has been in existence since 2017, and was created through a reality show of the same name.</p><h2><span id=The_Net_Worth_of_Lee_Know>The Net Worth of Lee Know</span></h2><p>As of early-2020, Lee Know has a net worth reputedly over $1 million, earned through a successful career in the music industry. He’s worked on numerous music projects with Stray Kids, and has also been involved in numerous endorsements during his career.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Career_Beginnings>Early Life and Career Beginnings</span></h2><p>From a young age Lee was interested in pursuing a career as a male idol. He started auditioning at the first opportunity he got, and was successful in joining JYP Entertainment. The company is one of the largest of its kind in South Korea, responsible for production, managing talents, events management, music publishing and many more. Some of their most popular artists include Twice, Day6, Got7, and Itzy.</p><p>After training with the company for a year, he was introduced to the public through a reality survival show called “Stray Kids”, which was intended to finalize the members of JYP’s planned&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>boy group of the same name</a>.</p><p>The show continued JYP’s trend of having trainees match up against idols from JYP. The show lasted for 10 episodes, and Lee was one of the two who were eliminated from the competition, but JYP ultimately decided that all nine members who participated in the show would be a part of the final lineup of Stray Kids. Through the show, the group released their first single called “Hellevator”.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Fame_with_Stray_Kids>Rise to Fame with Stray Kids</span></h2><p>After the show, the official Stray Kids website was launched, and they then worked on their debut extended play (EP) called “Mixtape”.</p><p>The EP featured a total of seven tracks – including their first release “Hellevator” – which were all worked on by the members in terms of songwriting and composition. The group subsequently released their singles online, firstly a song called “Beware”, before releasing “Spread My Wings”.

They then released their next EP called “I Am Who”, which had the title track “My Pace”. Afterward, they held their third showcase at the Olympic Hall which was also set to introduce their next release “I Am You”.</p><p>In 2019 the group came back with a new EP “Cle 1: Miroh”, which was released as a part of the celebration of the group’s first anniversary.</p><p>This led to their first win in a music show, specifically “M Countdown” thanks to their lead single “Miroh”. They followed it up with the continuation of the EP called “Cle 2: Yellow Wood”, which was also the precursor to their world tour across Europe and North America.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>200216 'District 9 : Unlock' in LOS ANGELES<br>preview<a rel=nofollow href=#>#리노</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#LeeKnow</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#StrayKids</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>#스트레이키즈</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/GLxOSunAZr</a></p><p>— 노.만 (@KNOWONEELSE1025) <a rel=nofollow href=#>February 17, 2020</a></p><p>Later in the year they announced the District 9 Unlock World Tour along with their next EP “Cle: Levanter”. However, shortly after the announcement, it was announced that group member Woojin would be&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>leaving</a>&nbsp;the group, which led to a one month delay, and they then released their first single – “Astronaut” – without Woojin.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>It is known that Lee Know is single, still young and focused on his career with Stray Kids rather than pursuing any long term relationships.</p><p>It is also generally believed that management is strict when it comes to the relationships their talents keep, especially in South Korea, so preserving a certain image.
