Explore His Ethnicity And Nationality</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Tony Romo</strong>, the former NFL quarterback, is from a mixed family with Mexican-American ancestors on his father’s side and a California upbringing.

Despite being a California native, Romo spent his childhood in southern Wisconsin, where he acquired an unexpected love for the Green Bay Packers.&nbsp;This combination of cultural influences adds a fascinating element to Romo’s biography, piqueing the quarterback’s interest in the history that has formed him.</p><p>Antonio Ramiro Romo was a well-known American football quarterback who spent 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys.&nbsp;Despite being undrafted in 2003, he signed as a free agent with the Cowboys.&nbsp;Romo led the Cowboys to four playoff berths and set franchise marks for throwing touchdowns, passing yards, and games with at least 300 passing yards.&nbsp;Due to a preseason back injury, he retired following the 2016 season and is currently the main color commentator for CBS Sports’ NFL telecasts.</p><h2>Tony Romo’s Nationality And Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Tony Romo</strong> was born on April 21, 1980, in San Diego, California, in the United States.

Joan, his mother, is of German and Polish descent.&nbsp;Tony has always valued his ancestry despite having a varied upbringing.&nbsp;Tony’s grandpa told KVUE that he is always proud of who he is, alluding to his race. “He recognizes himself as Antonio Ramiro Romo.
