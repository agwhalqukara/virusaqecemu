According to his <a href=#>Twitter</a> account, he's a student at NYU, as well as a fashion blogger who writes under the moniker "The Fashion Gangster." White Bird in a Blizzard is his first major feature film.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Back in 2012, the actor did an interview for <a href=#>NYU Local</a> about what it was like to make the transition from TV star to student. "I'm not the type of person that looks for people to recognize me and talk to me," he said at the time, adding later that he's really "shy and awkward" in person.&nbsp;</p><p>"On the first day of classes…I was like nauseous. I didn't want to go," he admitted. "I feel like the way that I dress…I don't really blend in with the crowd normally, so people mistake that as me being confident, when in reality, I am so, so shy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKygpKlir6bA07KqZqWRp7hutc2dnKWhk5bBsHnIrGSapJxitLO71qdkrqhdna60ecBmpK6rpJawqbGMa2dqbGFrfnE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-30-highest-paying-jobs-and-professions-in-south-africa-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Top 30 highest-paying jobs and professions in South Africa 2024</span></a>
