The <a href=#>University of South Africa</a> revealed that destroyed degrees cannot be replaced. Netizens roasted her and called her foolish for destroying her qualifications, with some accusing her of doing it for content.</p><h2>Graduate burns her degree</h2><p class=align-left>The Black Lawyers Association's student chapter resident Kgomotso Tejane said that the graduate's actions contributed to a lesser understanding of the legal profession. According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TimesLIVE</a></i>, he added that those who want to enter the legal profession should understand the pros and cons of <a href=#>becoming practitioners in that sector</a>. Tejane believes that the legal space is competitive and the country lacks enough resources and firms to accommodate the graduates entering the labour force.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <i>Have you recorded a funny video or filmed the moment of fame, cool dance, or something bizarre?

He added that the university only issues an academic record, and for the graduate to obtain it, they would have to provide information, including what happened to their degree and their contact details, as well as the qualification's name.</p><h2>South Africans diss graduate</h2><p class=align-left>Netizens on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> were disappointed in the student and slammed her actions.</p><p class=align-left>Olebogeng Legote asked:</p>“How stupid can you be to burn your qualification? That meant the blood, sweat and tears were all for nothing.”<p class=align-left>Brian Halsall added:</p>“Surely they can’t be that stupid. If it’s true, what type of lawyers will they be?”<p class=align-left>Kgolagano Pride Khalo remarked:</p>“Stupid things we do for content!”<p class=align-left>Marcus M Chokwe was incredulous.</p>“Only one year? She’s so immature. Too immature to be in any profession, let alone legal.”<p class=align-left>Sgegede Insizwayaka Nongombhili wrote:</p>“People do stupid stuff to get social media attention, shame. I’m sure she’s regretting wherever she is.”<h2>2 students caught cheating during exam</h2><p class=align-left>In another article, <strong>Briefly News</strong> reported that two students from Walter Sisulu University <a href=#>were caught cheating during an exam</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The university said that they were caught thanks to the state-of-the-art surveillance system they installed. <a href=#>South Africans</a> were dumbfounded as to how they could cheat in a room full of cameras.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLS71K2fZpmWp7akrY5qbmtwaGZ6trrIrJhmpJGseqi%2BwJ2smqyVYrCwusOepKedlGKvunnBpZico12hrrjFxKuqZpmjqLyktcCtoKimXZfCs7rIp55mnJWcv6axjKyYZqyipLmtv4yhnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noah-thompson-and-fritz-hager-covid-update-american-idol-2022-contestant-where-are-they-now.html><span>←</span><span>Noah Thompson And Fritz Hager Covid Update: American Idol 2022 Contestant - Where Are They Now</span></a>
