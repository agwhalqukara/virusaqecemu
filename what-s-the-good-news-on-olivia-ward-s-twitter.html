She‚Äôs the woman who decided to compete with her sister to lose weight and gain control of her health on the hit reality series The Biggest Loser. &nbsp;She was a woman who just did not like herself the way she was. She did not love the person she‚Äôd become, and she did not like that she‚Äôd lost so much control over her life because of her weight and her unhealthy lifestyle. She wanted to take control of her life and her body, and that‚Äôs what she did. She competed with her sister, and the two were the top two in the competition. She went on to win, losing more weight than anyone else in the competition during her season. Her weight caused her to be diagnosed with a health issue that almost made it impossible for her to have kids, and she felt it was hindering her career opportunities. Now that she‚Äôs lost so much weight and gotten back on a healthy track, she‚Äôs got some great news. And the reality star has been showing her love of her new body and her new life on her social media pages. We took a look at<a href=#> Olivia Ward‚Äôs</a> Twitter page to see some of her most exciting posts.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So excited to share this with you‚Ä¶<a href=#>@benwardmusic</a> and I are blessed beyond words! <a href=#>http://t.co/sCG3g2kYbI</a> via <a href=#>@usweekly</a></p><p>‚Äî Olivia Ward (@BL11Olivia) <a href=#>February 19, 2015</a></p><p>Olivia Ward is finally expecting a baby, which is something she never actually thought was possible with her health issues.
