So, I’ve learned a lot from my last relationship, and I really, really value my privacy now, so I think “less is more” for this one.”</p><p>“I won’t be making YouTube videos about my relationship, our time together, and our trips together. I also won’t be doing boyfriend tags or other videos about my boyfriend. I just decided that being in a relationship and looking for love are very important to me. I would never let other people’s opinions get in the way of something I really want,” she said at the time. “I’m so happy right now, and I feel like life has given me whole new energy. My vibes aren’t the same. My aura is probably a new color or something, so I just wanted to let you know that yes, I’m dating someone, yes, I’m so, happy, and yes, he treats me so, incredibly well.”</p><h2 id=lauren-riihimaki-net-worth>Lauren Riihimaki Net Worth In 2022</h2><p dir=ltr>Lauren Riihimaki has an estimated net worth of $5 million dollars.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Lauren is called a DIY queen by people and she has a huge fan base.
