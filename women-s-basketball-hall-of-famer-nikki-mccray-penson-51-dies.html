The cause of death has not been announced. McCray-Penson and her husband, Thomas Penson, have a son, Thomas Jr., who turned 10 in February.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">McCray-Penson was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2013, during her tenure with <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>South Carolina</a>, where she was an assistant to her close friend and Olympic teammate <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Dawn Staley</a>. She was part of Staley's staff as the Gamecocks won the 2017 NCAA championship. Soon after, she took her first head-coaching job, with <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Old Dominion</a>.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Thank you my little sister, my friend, my foxhole partner, my teammate, my fast food snacker, my basketball junkie, my fellow Olympian, my gold medalist and now my angel," <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Staley posted to Twitter</a> along with a statement. "... Suffer no more Nik Nik."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In all, including last season at Rutgers, McCray-Penson had 16 years of college coaching experience, serving as head coach at <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Mississippi State</a> and ODU. After consecutive 20-win seasons, she left the Monarchs to take over the Bulldogs, who went 10-9 during the COVID-19-impacted 2020-2021 season. In October 2021, before the start of what would have been her second season at MSU, she stepped down to focus on her health.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Heart hurts like crazy over this one," two-time WNBA MVP and <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Las Vegas Aces</a> standout <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>A'ja Wilson</a>, star of South Carolina's 2017 title team, wrote on Twitter. "Such a fighter and a warrior with the sweetest gentle soul! Coach McCray you've helped me in many, many ways and you were a true gift from God! Truly will be missed! No more suffering, no more pain! God got a good one."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">She <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>returned to coaching</a> this past season, becoming an assistant to <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Coquese Washington</a> at Rutgers.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Nikki had a big smile and an even bigger heart," Washington said in a statement provided by Rutgers. "She was full of life, energy, and was so much fun to be around. Nikki touched the lives of many because she made it her mission to uplift others and help them achieve whatever dreams and goals they expressed. She was so devoted to her husband and son, and still gave all of herself to everyone in the program. We will miss her dearly but will keep Nikki's memory alive in our hearts."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A native of Collierville, Tennessee, McCray-Penson helped the Lady Vols win three SEC regular-season championships and two SEC tournament titles. They also made a women's Final Four appearance in 1995, when Tennessee fell in the championship game to <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Connecticut</a>.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Our hearts are broken as we mourn the loss of a beloved Lady Vol," Tennessee coach Kellie Harper said in a statement. "We also offer our love and sincere condolences to her family, friends and colleagues across the country. Nikki had a bright and loving personality and touched the lives of everyone she met. Her kind and genuine spirit will be missed."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">After college, McCray-Penson was named to the U.S. national team, which trained and toured together from fall 1995 until the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. That U.S. team's popularity and success was seen as the springboard to the launch of the WNBA in 1997, and was chronicled in the ESPN 30 for 30 special "Dream On," which was released last year.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Our hearts are heavy as we learn of the passing of Nikki McCray-Penson," the WNBA said in a statement. "... Our thoughts and prayers are with Nikki's family and loved ones at this time."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">McCray-Penson was a three-time All-Star during her nine years in the WNBA and won gold medals with Team USA in the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We are heartbroken to hear this news," <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Indiana Fever</a> general manager Lin Dunn said on Twitter. "Nikki was a part of our first Fever playoff team; our thoughts and prayers go out to her family."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">McCray-Penson also led the Columbus Quest to the 1997 ABL championship, as she played in that league before moving to the WNBA. She was the ABL's MVP in 1997.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Nikki was a tremendous competitor," Brian Agler, who coached McCray-Penson with the Quest, told ESPN. "She could dominate a game with her defensive abilities and her aggressive offensive style. She had such a tremendous work ethic. I know her Columbus Quest family, friends and fans respect her and will miss her."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">McCray-Penson was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCfz6ipratfrLyusc2sZJuZo6Cyta7ApaNmoJGhuW6ywKacq2WenristYymmpyqka56sbHNrKanZWVmfLTAzquweKGUcn5xfJdtamxpYw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-don-t-humans-have-tails-this-new-study-has-a-possible-answer.html><span>←</span><span>Why Don't Humans Have Tails?
