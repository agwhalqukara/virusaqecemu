Tell you anything?,” wrote another tweeter.</p><p>Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz also made an appearance on Fox News that same night to give his evaluation of Harris’ tenure in office. Moskowitz revealed that the same poll that reported the vice president’s drop in favorability also shows Biden has a 49 percent to -45 percent lead in current approval ratings over Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>“[Harris] is part of the Biden administration. That very same poll shows them as a ticket beating the Republican contender by four points,” Moskowitz said. “That’s the American people in that very same poll.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49vZmtxX5Z6uLvMmqVmoaNitq%2BvwKmYm6SVYrynecGeoKefXau2pLGMqameq5mZsq%2FAjJ%2BmsWWemsS0eceoqq1lmpqur7XNnmSpoaKnvG6x16mpnqujmrFuwMeoqp5lo5q7tbXMnqWtq12staq4xGaYoqqZo7RuwMeorKCgpKh6sLqMpJimmZyWeqmt0augrGWgmr%2Bnu9GmmKeblWKutHnVqWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-the-internet-obsessed-with-margot-robbie-s-feet-even-she-is-surprised.html><span>←</span><span>Why Is The Internet Obsessed With Margot Robbies Feet?
