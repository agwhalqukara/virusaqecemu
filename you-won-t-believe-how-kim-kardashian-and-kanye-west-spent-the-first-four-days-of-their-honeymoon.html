The wedding, like almost anything this celebrity duo do, was an over-the-top romantic celebration that included several events in several countries. It also included a little photo-editing on their honeymoon.</p><p>According to a statement made by West, the couple’s Vogue cover photographer, Annie Leibovitz, was on hand to shoot their wedding ceremony, cancelling her role as photographer a few hours before the ceremony leaving the couple in a bind. West also stated he believed that the long-famous award-winning photographer, “was, like, scared of the idea of celebrity,” before stating that he took care of the photo editing of his wedding photos himself because his new bride is so important to the internet.</p><p>“Because Annie pulled out, I was like, ‘Okay, I still want my wedding photos to look like Annie Liebovitz,’ and we sat there and worked on that photo for, like, four days before the flowers were off-color,” he said in reference to the now famous photo of the duo kissing in their wedding attire in front of a wall of white flowers.</p><p>West goes on to say that he did it all for Kim, even thought it meant the couple spent the first four days of their Irish honeymoon in their hotel room editing photos, which, allegedly, is not something that pleased Kardashian. The photo, according to West, is now the most liked photo on Instagram. He views his time spent editing the photo as a success thanks to that fact.</p><p>(Photo by Noel Vasquez/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiuqKakYq%2BmuMierZ5lm566brfAq5uaq5ierq95ypqlsp1drLK0wIysp56mpGKzqr7SrWSfp6WneqWt2Kxkoaeemsauu86nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-mcmanus-net-worth-age-height-birthday-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Scott McManus - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</span></a>
